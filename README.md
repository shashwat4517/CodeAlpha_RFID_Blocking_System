🔐 RFID Blocking System
📌 Project Overview

The RFID Blocking System is a cybersecurity-focused project designed to prevent unauthorized RFID scanning (skimming) of sensitive items such as:

💳 Credit / Debit Cards
🛂 Passports
🆔 Identity Documents

This project demonstrates how Faraday cage principles and electromagnetic shielding can be applied to protect personal data from contactless theft.

🎯 Objective
  To design and implement a physical and conceptual RFID protection system that blocks malicious RFID readers and prevents data theft in real-world scenarios.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered

  RFID Technology (HF – 13.56 MHz)
  
  RFID Vulnerabilities & Skimming Attacks
  
  Faraday Cage Principle
  
  Electromagnetic Shielding
  
  Cybersecurity in Physical Systems

⚠️ Problem Statement

  RFID-enabled cards continuously respond to nearby readers. Attackers can exploit this using portable scanners to:
  
  Steal card information
  
  Clone passports
  
  Perform identity theft
  
  This project addresses these risks using a simple, low-cost, and effective solution.

🛡️ Proposed Solution
  RFID Blocking Using Faraday Cage Principle
  
  A metal-lined shielding layer is used to block radio frequency signals, preventing RFID cards from being energized or read by unauthorized scanners.

🧪 Implementation Approaches
🔹 1. Physical RFID Blocking Wallet / Sleeve

  Materials Used:
  
  Aluminum foil / Copper tape
  
  Cardboard or plastic cover
  
  Optional cloth or leather

  Working:
  
  The metal layer absorbs or reflects RFID signals
  
  Prevents communication between the card and scanner
  
  🔹 2. Conceptual Enhancements
  
  Active RFID jamming cards
  Smart enable/disable RFID cards
  Secure passport covers with multi-layer shielding
